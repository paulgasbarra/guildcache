Guildcache is a CRM specifically designed to support schools training students in various technologies.

It uses a Django REST API to manage the backend and a React Application on the frontend built with Vite.

Currently the site is hosted on Netlify for the frontend and heroku for the backend.

The heroku database is currently essential and has no automatic backup services associated with it.
